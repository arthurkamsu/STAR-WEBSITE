STAR ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use our application.

1. No Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal information from users of our application.
Our app operates entirely on your device and does not connect to external servers to transmit or retrieve data.

2. No Permissions Required
Our application does not require any special permissions (e.g., camera, location, contacts) to function.
This means it does not access or interact with your personal data or device features.

3. Children's Privacy
Since we do not collect any information from users, our app is safe for use by children under the age of 13 and complies with COPPA (Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act).

4. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. If we make any changes, the updated policy will be posted within the app or on this page, and the "Effective Date" above will be revised.
